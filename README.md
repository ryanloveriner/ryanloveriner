## Hello! ðŸ‘‹ My name is Ryan Love-Riner, and I'm a Data Analyst.
## I'm currently working for a specialty coffee roasting company, developing data visualizations using Python and Tableau and statistical models using R. I also report KPIs and communicate quantitative insight to our key stakeholders, all while managing our ever-growing mountain of data (we roast over 60,000 pounds of coffee a year!) with SQL and Kaggle. Combining these analytical skills with a passion for coffee and customer-focused process/product improvement, I work to ensure my company is always at the cutting edge of coffee roasting science.
