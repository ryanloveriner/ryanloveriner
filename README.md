## Hello! ðŸ‘‹ My name is Ryan Love-Riner, and I'm a junior Data Analyst.
## I work for a specialty coffee roasting company, developing data visualizations and statistical models using R, SQL, and Excel to improve our roasting quality and consistency and to drive key business insights.
## I'm also developing skills in Tableau and Power BI in order to continue improving our program, which sources, stores, roasts, packages, and sells over 50,000 pounds of specialty coffee a year.
